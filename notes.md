cost-saving inputs:
 - make coffee at home vs. buying from cafe ($2/day * 5 days/week * 52 weeks/year) => total $520/year
 - replace cable subscription with 1 streaming service.  Average Household Cable Package is $217/mo (https://decisiondata.org/news/report-the-average-cable-bill-now-exceeds-all-other-household-utility-bills-combined/)
    - Yearly savings is 2,412 (based on a Netflix subscription of $16/mo)
- Cutting your own hair (or having a friend/family member do it) (158.90 + 104.21) / 2 = 131.55 yearly cost (One time cost of $40 for a hair cutting kit).  First year's contribution will be 91.55, and every subsequent year is 131.55 (Maybe replace the kit every 5 years.)
- making lunch vs. buying lunch ($5 savings * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year) => $1250
